Savings Calculator with React
# Project Description: Savings Calculator with React

This project is a **Savings Calculator** built using React, designed to help users visualize their savings growth over time based on key financial inputs. The application allows users to input four main parameters:

1. **Initial Investment**: The amount of money initially deposited.
2. **Annual Investment**: The additional amount invested each year.
3. **Expected Return**: The annual interest rate (in percentage) expected on the investments.
4. **Duration**: The total number of years the investment will grow.

Using these inputs, the calculator generates a detailed year-by-year breakdown of the savings growth. The results are displayed in a table, showing the following metrics for each year:

- **Year**: The current year of the investment.
- **Starting Amount**: The amount available at the beginning of the year.
- **Annual Investment**: The additional amount invested in that year.
- **Total Invested**: The sum of the starting amount and the annual investment.
- **Interest**: The interest earned for that year, calculated based on the expected return.
- **Ending Amount**: The total amount at the end of the year, including the interest earned.

The application uses **compound interest calculations** to ensure accurate projections. It provides a clear and interactive way for users to understand how their savings can grow over time, making it a useful tool for financial planning.

**This super simple project** aims to practice React fundamentals, including state management, form handling, and dynamic rendering of data in tables.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
